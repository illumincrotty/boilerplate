## 🧐 About

Important but basic info

## Install

### Package Manager

#### NPM <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
npm i package_name
```

#### PNPM <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
pnpm add package_name
```

#### Yarn <!-- omit in TOC -->

```sh
yarn add package_name
```

### CDN

#### Skypack <!-- omit in TOC -->

For Web and Deno, no install is required! Just put this line at the top of your file:

```typescript
import { inflate } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/package_name';
```

If you want type support with skypack, follow the directions [here]('https://docs.skypack.dev/skypack-cdn/code/javascript#using-skypack-urls-in-typescript')

#### UNPKG <!-- omit in TOC -->

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/package_name"></script>
```

And use it like you would any other package from UNPKG


## 🔧 Running the tests

The basic set of tests are in the test script, the coverage script, and the report script. Just run those using your perferred package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) to make sure nothing has broken.

## 🎈 Usage

Here's the great part: thanks to [microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle), this package supports CJS, UMD, and ESM formats.
That means that wherever and however you use this package — in browser or node, with import or require — you *should* be set, no configuration required.
